#### Purpose
The the purpose of this project is to analysis a small number of stocks 
and then predict the stock values using a Stacked Keras Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) asprovided by SkLearn.

#### Analysis
* This program will read recent stock data of six select stocks for three different market segments.
* I perform standard graphic analysis looking a the stocks performance; price, volume and volitility (histograms and Kurtosis) 
* I then look at correlations between the stock with pairplots and heatmaps

#### Prediction
* Lastly I use Keras/Tensorflow LSTM libraries predict the 20 days of stocks value and compare it to the actual prices.
